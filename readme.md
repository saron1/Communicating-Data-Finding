## by Saron Tessera 


## Dataset

> The FordGoBike data is a dataset that includes the information of individual riders. It gives a detailed information about the rides taken by members in th San Francisco bay area. They offer all residents of the Bay Area an affordable, accessible, and fun new transportation option. Anyone who has access to the membership has thousands of bikes across San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose to choose from.
> The dataset that I choose is 2018 January datasets. The Dataset contains 94802 rows and 16 columns.The dataset is tidy but I still made some changes to the dataset inorder to easy the analysis process. The fields that is included are start and end time, bike id, user type, duration sec, station start time/end time, gender and birth year. 

## Summary of Findings

> Since the main purpose of the exploration was to understand more about the pattern  and behavior of the members. One of the base fields I used is the start time. Using the start time, I was able to understand the traffic of bike ride. In general, I saw that the highest traffice was recored during in the morning between 8am to 10 am and in the afternoon between 5pm - 6pm. In addition to that, I analyzd the dataset by  introducing attributes like user type, gender and age. I found out that customer user type trip duration is longer that subcriber user type. The peak hours for the traffic is different for customers and subscirbers. And male seem to me the most riders than female or other. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> For the presentation, I foucused on the pattern of members usage. I started with a single set of variable to see the traffic of rides by hour. In the second part, it breaks it into understanding user type hourly usage of bikes. At last, it see the pattern of usage by user type, gender and hourly trip.
